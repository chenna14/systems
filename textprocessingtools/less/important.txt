unix provides a lot of utilities to procoess the text files.

(sort) sorts a file.
(uniq) removes duplicate lines in a sorted file.
(wc) reports counts of characters, words, and lines in one or more files.

pattern matching on regular expressions is useful.
(grep)
(sed)
(awk)

use less -N file name to search for particular word or alphabet.(affter running the command click / and then proceed)

. indicates any single character (so f.a will highlight flat)

[AEIOU] matches any single vowel(uppercase)
[Bb] matches uppercase b or lowercase b
[a-z] matches any lowercase alphabet
[a-zA-Z] matches any alphabet
[A-Z][a-z ][a-z ].(matches regular expressions with uppercase character followed by lowercase character or space followed by lowercase character or space then anything.)

use ^ for negation.

[^ ] matches anything other than space.
[^AEIOUaeiou] matches anything other than vowel

use * for multpile

[a-z]* matches for any sequence of lowercase alphabets

[^a-zA-Z]* matches any sequence other than alphabetic

if you want to start matching from beginning of the line, use ^ as the first symbol.
if you want the match to finish at the end use $ as the last symbol.

^[a-zA-Z, ]*$ matches the lines starting at beginning of line and ending at end of line and having olnly alphabets or space or , inbetween the line.

. gives any character so to match to . use specaial characters. \.
