grep - Global Regular Expression print.
locates lines that contains match of regular expressions
may or maynot highlight the match.

run grep as:

  grep <OPTIONS> <PATTERN> <FILE(S)>

pattern is a regular expression.

grep line textfile.txt print lines that contains line.

use grep-e method as or.

for example

grep -e 'method ' -e line textfilel.txt

gives lines containing anyone or both.

what if we want only containing both?

to want lines wwhich do not contain regular expression use option -v

grep -v '[A-Z]' textfile.txt 

use -i for case insensitive search

for word based search use -w

grep '[A-Z]' textfile.txt incluse Chenna but if we use -w it will not include.

use -n to print the lines numbers also.

for recursive search in the current directory use -r or -R.

to print only file names use -l.
